        Just finished up "Assignment 0" of my CS 290 course.<br></br>

        I have worked with web design before as part of my employment at the university, so I am no stranger to HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript and the like. So, I found the construction of the page to be relatively simple. I have not really made heavy
        use of the &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;li&gt; elements in the past, so I got to learn about their operation, particularly with the nesting
        of lists. In addition, I never really used &lt;alt&gt; elements before, though this is mainly because I mainly worked on projects
        which could not make use of them very easily, if only due to the highly graphical nature of the content being worked with.<br></br>

        I have worked with GitHub before, so I had no trouble with making or pushing commits. That being said, I did have some
        confusion over how exactly one was to publish one's web pages. This matter was quickly cleared up when I looked on Piazza
        for posts regarding this issue.<br></br>

        As for what acted as my biggest resource for developing the web page (as well as this one), I would not actually say
        Piazza was my main go-to. Whenever I had a general point about the mechanics of HTML or its elements, I would first turn
        to the web and simply Google whatever I wanted to know about. Of the websites I used, perhaps w3schools.com would be the
        the one I used most heavily, simply by virtue of the fact that it had a great deal of information about modern HTML and
        it was all indexed in a fairly accessible manner.<br></br>

        While not even a required portion of the assignment, I probably found the formatting and styling of my web pages to be the most
        enjoyable, if only because I found that they looked horrific in  their unCSS'd form. Overall, this first assignment was relatively
        easy but still enjoyable.
