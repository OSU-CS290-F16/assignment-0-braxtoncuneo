    <pre>
        Just finished up "Assignment 0" of my CS 290 course.

        I have worked with web design before as part of my employment at the university, so I am no stranger to HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript and the like. So, I found the construction of the page to be relatively simple. I have not really made heavy
        use of the &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;li&gt; elements in the past, so I got to learn about their operation, particularly with the nesting
        of lists.

        I have worked with GitHub before, so I had no trouble with making or pushing commits. That being said, I did have some
        confusion over how exactly one was to publish one's web pages. This matter was quickly cleared up when I looked on Piazza
        for posts regarding this issue.

        As for what acted as my biggest resource for developing the web page (as well as this one), I would not actually say
        Piazza was my main go-to. Whenever I had a general point about the mechanics of HTML or its elements, I would first turn
        to the web and simply Google whatever I wanted to know about. Of the websites I used, perhaps w3schools.com would be the
        the one I used most heavily, simply by virtue of the fact that it had a great deal of information about modern HTML and
        it was all indexed in a fairly accessible manner.

        While perhaps not so much a point of difficulty as a point of frustration, I did not like that the web pages one was to
        develop as part of this first assignment had to be only in HTML. I understand that this is mainly meant to increase the
        accessibility of this class to people with no web development experience whatsoever. Nonetheless, I dislike that I was not
        able to have as much control over how my web pages look. For instance, without CSS, it is not particularly straightforward
        to get the text for this blog post to be indented and reasonably positioned. What is worse is that the instructions
        specifically ask for the web pages made to be 'nicely structured.' Indenting and partitioning sections of text to delineate
        scope, relevance to surrounding content, and level of importance is one of the most basic parts of good web design, of
        making a web page 'nicely structured.' The best I could do was put everything in a &lt;pre&gt; element, although this means
        that text will not automatically wrap to the page width and hence could not be all that friendly on devices with small
        screens.

        Needless to say, I can't wait until we get to the more advanced stuff.
