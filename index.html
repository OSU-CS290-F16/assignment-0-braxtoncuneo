            On a scale from 0 (I've never even seen HTML code) to 10 (You know Facebook? I wrote that.),
            how confident are you in your web development skills.

            I would rate myself as a 6. I have worked a lot in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of work, although I do
            not know the ins and outs of websites as a whole, I'd like to say I'm reasonably proficient.

            I hope to brush up on the basics and learn what I may have missed in my self-education regarding web development.

            I have, indeed, signed up for Piazza.

            A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had. Include only what you
            can think of and write down in two minutes, maximum.

            I greatly enjoy designing algorithms and artificial languages, and do so as a hobby. Current efforts include a hypothetical
            human-language-like semi-functional/semi-declarative language centralized upon metaprogramming (ala lisp), dynamic expression
            reduction, dynamic inferred structural typing (with optional dependent typing), rule space searching (ala prologue), as well
            as dynamic scope manipulation for problem space reduction. I like to call the language Garden Noam, because of the heavy
            use of context, grammar and lexical relations as well as the lisp-like tree structure it would theoretically manipulate.
